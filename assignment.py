    # Task 2: Calculate the sum of the third row
    

    # Task 3: Find the maximum element in the last column
    

    # Task 4: Flatten the matrix into a 1D list
    

    # Task 5: Perform list modifications
    # Append an element to the list
    

    # Insert an element at a specific position
